# Matrix
This is a proxy that allows you to use hacks on vanilla minecraft.

Minecraft 1.20.1 is fully supported, for the rest you may need to use viaproxy.

This proxy is almost undetectable, except for the blatant hacks such as fly.

Some servers don't work, if you have a server that doesn't work, make a pull request with the ip (only if it is minecraft 1.20.1) 
I'll try to make it work.

This proxy is not made for huge amount of players, for that you may need to run multiple instances.

You can edit this proxy but please leave some credits, this took so many hours to make.

Huge thanks to the PrismarineJS team for making this possible!
